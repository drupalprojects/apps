Developing an App

The Apps module provides a way to locally develop and test apps.
This document discuss how to do that.

Enable the development console from the Apps Configuration page located at admin/config/system/apps

Reference the manifest from the module.info and make sure the server is development:
apps[server] = development
apps[manifests][] = app/manifest.app

and place your manifest and images in a subfolder of the module
  app/
    manifest.app

The manifest.app should be an ini file with the following items
  name = Test App
  description = Test App is used to show how apps work
  machine_name = test_app
  version = 1.0
  downloadable = test_app 1.0
  author = Phase2 Techonology
  author_url = http://www.phase2technology.com
  screenshots[] = screenshot.jpg
  screenshots[] = screenshot2.jpg
  logo = logo.png
  dependencies[views] = views 3.0-beta3
  dependencies[ctools] = ctools 1.0-alpha4
  libraries[arc] = arc
  downloadables[arc] = http://github.com/semsol/arc2/zipball/v2.0.0
  downloadables[views 3.0-beta3] = http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/views-7.x-3.0-beta3.tar.gz
  downloadables[ctools 1.0-alpha4] = http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/ctools-7.x-1.0-alpha4.tar.gz
  downloadables[test_app 1.0] = http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/test_app-7.x-1.0.tar.gz
